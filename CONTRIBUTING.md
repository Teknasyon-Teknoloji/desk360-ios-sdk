# Contributing

* Use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)! [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)  is used to keep the code consistent and clean.
* Add tests! - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
* Document any change in behaviour - Make sure the README.md and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
* Consider our release cycle - We try to follow SemVer v2.0.0. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
* One pull request per feature - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
* Please try follow solid principles.
